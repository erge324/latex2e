%% This is a patch of the LaTeX kernel to support UTF8 character in
%% all places where they can be supported by an 8bit engine such as
%% pdfTeX.
%%
%%
%% This should enable UTF8 not only in ordinary text (as
%% already provided by a recent LaTeX release but in addition
%% supports:
%%
%%  - utf8 characters in file names used by \input \includegraphics
%%    and the like --- this includes spaces and it is not longer necessary
%     to quote the file name in this case (not possible is the use of
%%    the " as part of a file name, this is restriction of the library
%%    the TeX engines use).
%%
%%  - use of all utf8 characters in labels
%%
%%  - in contrast to the utf8 characters that are used in typesetting
%%    it is not necessary that LaTeX has any knowledge how to render
%%    the character, e.g., without loading the textcomp package it is
%%    not possible to typeset â‚¬ but even then you can have a file or a
%%    label with that character.
%%
%%
%% The plan is to integrate this patch (or a version of it) into the
%% kernel. Thus the current external version is intended to invite
%% tests with real documents beyond the test suite that we have
%% available at our disposal.
%%
%%
%% If you find any issues, please prepare a short example and submit
%% it as an issue at
%%
%%    https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues
%%
%% Thanks!

% utf8
%
%
%  whenever we encounter a UTF8 char in non-typesetting  situation we make sure it
%  doesn't expand.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

% Approach
%
% The utf8 characters are seen by an 8-bit engine as a sequence of octets.
%
% We make each starting octet an active character.
%

%  - When typesetting we pick up the necessary number of additional
%    octets check if they form a command that LaTeX knows about
%    ( \csname u8:\string#1\string#2...\encsname ) and if so use that
%    for typesetting.  \string is needed as the octets may (all?) be
%    active and we want the literal values in the name.

%  - If the utf8 character is going to be part of a label then it is
%    essentially becoming part of some csname and with the
%    test \ifincsname we can find this out. If so we render the whole
%    sequence off octets harmless by using \string too when the
%    starting octet executes.
%

%  - Another possible case is that \protect has *not* the meaning
%    of \typeset@protect. In that case we may do a write or we may do
%    a \protected@edef or ...  In all such cases we want to keep the
%    sequence of octets unchanged, but we can't use \string since at
%    least in the case of \protect@edef the result may later be
%    typeset after all (in fact that is quite likely) and so at that
%    point the starting octet needs to be an active character again
%    (the others could be stringified). So for those cases we use \noexpand.
%

%  So the code for a start octet of a two byte sequence would there
%  look like this:

%
%
% \long\def\UTFviii@two@octets{%
%   \ifincsname
%     \expandafter
%     \UTF@twostring@octets
%   \else
%     \ifx\protect\@typeset@protect
%     \else
%       \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter
%      \UTF@twoharmless@octets
%     \fi
%   \fi
%   \UTFviii@two@octets@do
% }
% 

% \ifcsname is tested first because that can be true even if we are
%  otherwise doing typesetting. If this is the case use \string on the
%  whole octet sequence. \UTF@twostring@octets not only does this but
%  also gets rid of \UTFviii@two@octets@do in the input stream by
%  picking it up as a first argument and dropping it.
%
% If this is not the case and we are doing typesetting (i.e., \protect
%  is \typeset@protect) then execute \UTFviii@two@octets@do which
%  picks up all octets and typesets the character (or generates an
%  error if it doesn't know how to typeset it).
%
% If we are not doing typesetting then we run \UTFviii@two@octets@do
%  which is like \UTF@twostring@octets but uses \noexpand instead
%  of \string. This way the sequence is temporay frozen, eg would
%  display as is or stays put inside a \protected@edef but if the
%  result is later reused the starting octet is still active.
%
% The definitions for the other starting octets are the same except
% that they pick up more octets after them.



% In the original all starting octets would be defined as calling such
%  a \UTFviii@...@octets command followed by a \string version of the
%  octet itself (so that it can be used to form the character). We now
%  need to keep that octet active and so we have to do a slightly
%  different setup.
%
%
% So here is the new setup loop. Note that for error cases we can and
%  should of course use a \string version of the octet since there is
%  no point do extra work.

% File name handling is done by generating a csname from the provided

%  due to the above procedure). By setting \escapchar to -1 we ensure
%  that we don't get a \ in front. As a result we end up with all
%  characters as catcode 12 (plus spaces). We then sometimes add
%  quotes around the contruct (removing any existing inner
%  quotes. Somes we only remove the quotes if they have been supplied
%  by the user. There is clearly some room for improvement.
%
% A side effect of the new code is that we will see quotes around file
%  name displays where there haven't been any before.
